The aim in this repository is to code up some different Kalman filters (e.g. standard, extended, unscented) and compare them.  
Also to try coding them in different ways and see how it affects various characteristics, mainly usability.

For the comparison/evaluation side of things it might have been easier to do this in a different language e.g. Python for easier access/integration with plotting and similar tools.
